The girl was one of those pretty and charming young creatures who sometimes
are born, as if by a slip of fate, into a family of clerks. She had no dowry,
no expectations, no way of being known, understood, loved, married by any rich
and distinguished man; so she let herself be married to a little clerk of the
Ministry of Public Instruction.

She dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was unhappy as
if she had really fallen from a higher station; since with women there is
neither caste nor rank, for beauty, grace and charm take the place of family
and birth. Natural ingenuity, instinct for what is elegant, a supple mind are
their sole hierarchy, and often make of women of the people the equals of the
very greatest ladies.

Mathilde suffered ceaselessly, feeling herself born to enjoy all delicacies
and all luxuries. She was distressed at the poverty of her dwelling, at the
bareness of the walls, at the shabby chairs, the ugliness of the curtains. All
those things, of which another woman of her rank would never even have been
conscious, tortured her and made her angry. The sight of the little Breton
peasant who did her humble housework aroused in her despairing regrets and
bewildering dreams.
